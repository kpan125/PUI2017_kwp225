HW 9

Part 1: Plot Peer Review

Reviewed the HW 8 plots for Tarek Arafat (tma353) and Baoling Zhou (bz882).

Part 2: GeoPandas & Census

I worked on this alone. The extra credit code for spatial lag came largely from the lab, and I used Prof. Biancoâ€™s choropleth function for most of the plotting.
