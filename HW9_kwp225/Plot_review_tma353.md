The plot is clear and easy to read, with clear quantities and units being shown. It would have been helpful to have gridlines and/or subticks to help the viewer approximate the counts for each category better. It would also be clear to explicitly state in the title that the data is for NYC buildings.

in the title the Class aka Topology, if it really is meant to indicate "aka" is distracting. In addition the plot title extends outside of the plot to the right which is both esthetically unpleasant (violating a number of rules about symmetry and spatial balance) and takes away space: if you were to put this in a page due to the title extending past the plot to the right you would have to make the plot smaller
The legend is redundant with the plot title, and redundant information hardly ever adds to clarity. In this case it certainly does not and it is aesthetically unappealing as well, since the legend in the empty right area is distracting

Color choice and unit labels are fine, but I would have changed the label of the category with the very long name (“Places of Public Assembly…”) so that there’s less wasted space. The legend in the bottom right corner is also unnecessary.

why are the axis labels green? this puts emphasis on the axis labels. Additionally the y label is out of the field of view, so far to the right It could be moved to the right side. 


The plot is honestly reproducing the data with no distortion to convey the message. However, since so many of the categories have tiny counts compared to the top few categories, it might be a good idea to group everything under a certain frequency into an “other” category. This would still preserve the message that the vast majority of buildings fall under the top few categories.
