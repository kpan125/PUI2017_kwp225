HW 10

Part 1: Worked alone, used thresholding method for event detection.

Part 2: Worked with Matt Sauter, with some discussion with Sam Ovenshine to help clarify the question. Used a combination of rolling mean smoothing, ratio calculation, AD Fuller test, and visual inspection to find the card types with the steepest increase and decrease in ridership.

Part 3: Worked with Matt Sauter and Valeria Schiavon, using Fourier transforms to find annual periodicity.
